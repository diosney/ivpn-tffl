                  Tax-Free For Life is a federally administered, weekly digital lottery created to support the Social
                  Security Trust Fund (SSTF) through a voluntary and innovative revenue stream—without raising payroll
                  or income taxes.
                </p>

                <p translate>
                  Unlike traditional lotteries, Tax-Free For Life offers a groundbreaking prize: a lifetime exemption
                  from federal income tax, or alternatively, a refund of the past ten years of federal taxes paid. This
                  once-in-a-lifetime reward transforms how Americans think about lotteries—by linking the thrill of
                  winning to a meaningful national cause.
                </p>

                <p translate>
                  How It Works:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li translate>Participants enter a weekly digital lottery.</li>

                  <li>
                    <span translate>Winners receive either:</span>

                    <ul>
                      <li translate>Permanent exemption from paying federal income tax, or</li>

                      <li translate>A lump-sum refund equal-to the federal taxes paid over the past 10 years.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li translate>All proceeds go directly toward strengthening the Social Security Trust Fund.</li>
                </ul>

                <p translate>
                  Why It Matters:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li translate>Strengthens Social Security: Offers a new funding source without burdening taxpayers.
                  </li>

                  <li translate>Voluntary Participation: Unlike tax hikes, it’s entirely optional.</li>

                  <li translate>Public Engagement: Leverages Americans' enthusiasm for lotteries to solve a national
                    challenge.
                  </li>

                  <li translate>Digital-First: Secure, accessible participation via modern digital platforms.</li>
                </ul>

                <p translate>
                  Tax-Free For Life is where personal reward meets patriotic purpose—giving Americans a chance to change
                  their lives and support the nation’s financial future at the same time.

                  The Automated Clearing House (ACH) Network is a highly reliable and efficient nationwide electronic
                  funds transfer system, governed by the NACHA Operating Rules, that provides for the interbank clearing
                  of electronic payments for participating depository financial institutions. The Federal Reserve and
                  Electronic Payments Network act as ACH Operators, central clearing facilities through which financial
                  institutions transmit or receive ACH transaction entries.

                <p translate>
                  An ACH debit is also known as an electronic check transaction. There is a slight delay in processing
                  these types of transactions to bank accounts. Think of it as writing a check, but it happens
                  electronically. These types of transactions typically take three (3) business days to post to your
                  bank account. It is your responsibility to ensure that funds are available at the time of the debit to
                  your account. As outlined in the terms of service, you are subject to a State fee for insufficient
                  funds if a purchase is returned by your bank. Depending on the State, fees range from $10 to $50.
